 *
 * jQuery Picture is a plugin to add support for responsive images to your layouts.
 * It supports both figure elements with some custom data attributes and the new
 * proposed picture format. This plugin will be made redundant when the format is
 * approved and implemented by browsers. Lets hope that happens soon. In the meantime
 * this plugin will be kept up to date with latest developments.
